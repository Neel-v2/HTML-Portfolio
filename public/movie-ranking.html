<h1>The Best Movies According To Me</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies Of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>This was Marvel at their best, and this movie had a very good storyline following all the characters that were built up over the past years, with an amazing plot twist ending.</p>

<h3>The Martian</h3>
<p>Everything in this movie could realisticly happen, and Andy Weir made sure of that when he wrote the book. It is very adventurous and has sort of an "anything could happen" feel</p>

<h3>Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse</h3>
<p>The animation in this movie was absolutely stunning and all the characters were well thought out and had a good place in the movie.</p>
